<h1>Welcome to the 2017 Steamworks Scouting Website!</h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;">This website was created to keep track of points, penalties, and other teams. We keep track of teams to build new stratigies, and improve for future years. These instructions will help guide you though the website and teach you how to use it properly.</p>
<h2><strong>Autonomus:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">The Autonomus period is at the beginning of the game, but no human players are allowed to controled the robot. This period will last 15 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<h2><strong>-Baseline:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">The baseline is during the autonomus period, and if crossed, it is worth five points.</p>
<h2><strong>-High and Low Goals:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">There are two types of goals in the game, the high and low goals. The high goal requires three fuel elements to earn a point, while the low goal requires nine fuel elements.</p>
<h2><strong>-Goal Made or Miss:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">"Goal Made" is when the fuel elements go in to boiler, and "Goal Missed" is when the robot attempted to make the goal.</p>
<h2><strong>-Gear Made or Miss:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Just like the goal made or goal miss, "Gear Made" is when the gears are delivered to the airship, and "Gear Missed" is when the robot attempted to deliver the gear. </p>
<h2><strong>-Incapacitated:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">If the robot is incapacitated, the robot cannot move for multiple reasons, like being tipped over part malfuction, etc...</p>
<h2><strong>-Position:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Position is where the robots end up after the Autonomus period. The robots could be anywhere on the field, but the most common areas are near the red/blue boiler,(depending on what color the team is on) the Far Pin,(away from the audience)and the close pin(close to the audience).</p>
</ul>
<h2><strong>TeleOp:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">The TeleOp period is after the Autonomus period, and human players are  now allowed to control the robots. This period will last two minutes and fifteen seconds.</p>
<ul>
<h2><strong>-Cycles:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Cycles are when a robot comes to and from the Retrieval Zone and the Boiler for fuel, or Loading station to the Airship for gears. </p>
<h2><strong>-Defence:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">This is if the team chooses to play defence to block the other team</p>
<h2><strong>-Climb Success:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">When 30 seconds remain of the match, human players will lower ropes the robots to climb. If the robot can light the touch pad, that team is awarded for 50 points.</p>
<strong><h2>-Climb Attempted/Unsuccessful:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">If the robot didn't make the climb, then the team will not be awarded 50 points.</p>
</ul>
<strong><h2>Penalties:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Penalities are given by many forms, technical, non-technical, yellow cards and red cards.</p>
<ul>
<strong><h2>-Foul:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Fouls are given by the referee and results in the other team earning 5 points. An example are the opposite team in the key for more than 5 seconds, and each second after the 5 seconds another foul is given.</p>
<h2><strong>-Tech Foul:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Tech fouls are also given by the referee, but results in the other team earning 25 points instead of 5. Some examples are contact with other robots while climbing the ropes, and contact with robots in retrieval.</p>
<h2><strong>-Yellow Cards:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">If a team recieves a yellow card, then that team will recieve a warning, but if a team recieves two cards, then it is turned into a red card.</p>
<h2><strong>-Red Cards:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">If a team recieves a red card, then that team will earn a disqualification.</p>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Comments:</strong></h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Comments are very helpful to understand penalties, specific problems that need to be noted, or anything else that needs to be noted.</p>
